        <p>In <strong>2007</strong>, AS-tegel was founded to sell for wholesale and retail.</p>

        <p>In <strong>2010</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.alltilesimport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">All Tiles Import</a> was founded for selling to wholesale.

        <p>By working together with our well known suppliers in Vietnam, China, India, Turkey and more, we strive for <strong>exclusive nature stone with excellent quality</strong>.
        Our purchasing manager visits the suppliers throughout the year on constant appointments to guarantee top quality for our products.</p><br>
